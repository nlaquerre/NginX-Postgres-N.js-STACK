# nginxStack1
My first fully successful REST API developement using NginX-controlled static AND Rest API hosting applying SSL encryption; also accompanied by a running but undeveloped PostgreSQL-13 DBMS.


I have a few API's drafted for accessing the database, and plenty of Database/Schema/SQL experience, so my next steps will be developing my skills in html/css/js to create well structured and unique front end web design, while furthing my familiarity when applying javaScript within this REST API.

Secondary, I will be implementing soft-encryption as I create a simple login/password system and also secure passwords when accessing the database via the node.js pg package.

I have a private, invite-only facebook group where you can find may latest tutorial videos. Here the most inexperienced Linux Virual Server User can learn step-by-step how I've implemented my favorite designs implemented on my dev server.  To view, just jump to the page and send me a request to join the group!  No awkward formal friend request required! Enjoy!
