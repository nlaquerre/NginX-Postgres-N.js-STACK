## ADDED MANUALLY CREATED LOG TRIGGER AND TABLE

Ahhh, nothing like a fresh contract with some new entrepreneurs to get me contributing to my github webserver design page again!  Now I know my system isn't the most complex you've ever seen, but I'll tell you, complexity never made things better in itself.  You can create secure, reliable, and scaleable servers without feeling all fancy and cool.  Well given I'm never one to just download a package (Unless it's node, since I just really can't stand JavaScript sometimes), I bypassed the audit postgres addon to create an easy system of logging, and decided to build my first manual trigger and trigger function in the PostgreSQL 13 DBMS.  Enjoy the beauty of manual logging!  Now if I can just 100% figure out the full complexities of the MVCC, I'll be ready to build a PostgreSQL masterpiece for real!!!

## FIRST UPLOAD

Basic upload of PostgreSQL backup 'dump'.  This test database commited right now has no real purpose, and was created simply to show that this version's API was functioning.  There will be more detailed database notes in the future, concerning constraints, authorization specifications, API-Database SQL descriptions, and general schema design.
