# DESIGN_NOTES--DatabaseSQL

Basic upload of PostgreSQL backup 'dump'.  This test database commited right now has no real purpose, and was created simply to show that this version's API was functioning.  There will be more detailed database notes in the future, concerning constraints, authorization specifications, API-Database SQL descriptions, and general schema design.
